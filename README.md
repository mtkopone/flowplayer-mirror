flowplayer-mirror is a flowplayer plugin which mirrors the video being played. 

Horizontally.  

That means left is right and vice versa.

To use it, put this in your flowplayer setup:

	plugins: {
	  mirror: {
	    url: '/your-url/flowplayer-mirror.swf'
	  }
	}

The binary is in [bin/](https://github.com/mtkopone/flowplayer-mirror/tree/master/bin)
It requires flash 10.0+


Enjoy,
